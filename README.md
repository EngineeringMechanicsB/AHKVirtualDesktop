# Windows Virtual Desktop
This is a small AutoHotkey project that provides lightweight virtual desktop and window management features for Windows. It was originally built for my own daily work needs and later shared publicly in case it may be useful to others.
The script keeps things simple — no heavy UI, no installation, and no system-level modifications — just keyboard-driven utilities to manage windows more efficiently.

## ✨ Features
Virtual desktop switching (up to 9 desktops)
Move windows between desktops
Pie menu for directional actions
Status bar with time and work progress display
Auto-generated configuration file
Clipboard recovery output
Optional Vim floating window integration
Optional terminal launcher
Minimal footprint, no background services

AutoHotkey v2


This script was created because I often needed to keep many windows open for work, but the machine was shared with other people. I couldn't install extra software or modify the system much, so I wrote a simple tool that improved my workflow without changing the environment.
Since it solved my own problem, I thought it might be helpful to share it with others as well.
